to start virtual env:                                              python -m venv <nameofvenv>
activate virtual env:                                             <nameofvenv>/Scripts/activate
installing necessary libraries:                               pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic

fastapi is for api development
uvicorn is the server which supports fastapi
pydantic is library which is used to set datatypes in fastapi coz just fastapi doesn't support datatypes(like javascript) so pydantic is like typescript


start uvicorn server which is always listening:         uvicorn <filename> : <fastapi object name> --reload

--reload (is to reload whenever there's a change in the server)
